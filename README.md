Quiz app build in React using API https://opentdb.com/

## Help please!!!

I'm rendering quiz components based on the API data. And these components in turn render components of possible answers.
In my answer elements I have build in logic for selecting an answer, and have a check for the correct answer. 
Now I'm trying to combine these two, find how many answers are correct and selected, and get this in the app component so it can in turn pass it to the scoredisplay component. 

I've tried adding a function to the app component and passing it to quiz which checks for these conditions. And then updates some variable in app. I can't quite figure out where the problem lies. And therefor don't know where to look for a sollution.

Any help would be greatly appreciated
